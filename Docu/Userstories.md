## Story time
I want to have a CO2 Warning system, that I can install in my office, that monitors the CO2 Levels.
It shall warn me, if these levels are too high. CO2 levels, which are too high have negative 
effects on the brain's functionality. Furthermore bad air also causes fatigue. Both factors 
would have a negative impact on my health and on my ability to solve problems. For this I want to
build a system. Furthermore this is to be seen as a learning project - in this project, I want to
build the entire machine from start to finish on my own. 
- I want to write the FW on a ÂµC that is foreign to me
- I want to design and manufacture the PCB
- I want to develop the housing in 3D CAD and manifactureit myself
Furthermore the device shall look like HAL9000 from space odysee. Its size shall be fairly small, 
so that it can sit on top of my computer screen. When the HALCO warns me, it shall only be really
annoying, when the air is terrible. Otherwise it shall be as subtle, yet noticable as possible. 
Since at least half of the day, I am not sitting in my office, the HALCO device shall remain
inactive, to increase the component's lifespan. Furthermore the Sensor housing needs to be properly
ventilaed, so that the measurement has as little delay as possible. It shall be able to run the 
system from a regular 5V USB powersource, as they are easy to find on a desktop workplace. In case
of a mal function, or for the case, that the sensor is not working, the system shall fail "loud and
noticable", so that I can determine, when the system is inactive.
The System shall be decent in its nature. It shall only disturb me, when the air is bad (for the 
case that I want to actually be disturbed). Otherwise it shall sit silently in the background. The
design of the housuing shall mimik HAL9000 as close as possible, yet have an appealing look, as I 
am watching at this every day, I spend at my desk.
